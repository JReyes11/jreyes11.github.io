          <div class="profile-text">Context:</div>  
          <br>In my previous role, I worked with a number of collegues outside of engineering who were frequently blocked when needing to create user accounts and
            perform any and all actions in the lower test environments.
            This reoccurance inspired me to create a UI that would perform the desired actions and required minimal user input. 
          <br><br>
            Ultimately I decided to build a google chrome extension, ( as opposed to using Express + Node.JS ) allowing for interactions with several dropdowns, radio buttons and checkboxes.
            From the quality perspective, unblocking my non technical collegues was a return on investment, as it utlimately led to exploratory testing efforts.
